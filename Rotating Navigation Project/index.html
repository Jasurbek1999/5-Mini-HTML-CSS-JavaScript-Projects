                In 2005, ScienceDirect held an experiment on canine behaviour, where they presented dogs with their owner’s scent, a scent of a stranger and the scent of food. Brain scans were taken of the dog as they approached each scent. The study hypothesised that since smell is so important to dogs, it would be the best way to understand how canine brains work.

They were right. Not only did dogs react more strongly to the scent of their owners, the part of the brain associated with enjoyment and positive emotions lit up when they were given their owner’s scent. Your loyal dog does recognise you. The same patterns in humans would usually be associated with love.

In another experiment, a dog was allowed to watch a stranger be rude to their owner. When the dog was then allowed to interact with the stranger and the owner, the dog actively snubbed the stranger. If that is not loyalty, we do not know what is.

                Sometimes you may need to encourage a loyal dog to be more independent. If your dog has grown too attached to you and is now more distant from other members of your family, this may cause a problem – especially if your dog has taken to growling when they believe you are in danger or are not being treated properly.

Such loyalty can also mean your dog is too attached to you and will grow stressed if you are out of their sight. This is not healthy and your dog should be able to feel like they belong to all members of your family. Take steps to try and correct this as soon as possible by ensuring that everyone is involved with their care; it will lead to a happier dog and home!
